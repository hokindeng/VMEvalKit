# VMEvalKit 🎥🧠

A framework to evaluate reasoning capabilities in video generation models at scale, through cognitive tasks. We **make it very convenient** to [**add models**](docs/ADDING_MODELS.md), [**add tasks**](docs/ADDING_TASKS.md), [**run inferences**](docs/INFERENCE.md), [**run evaluations**](docs/EVALUATION.md), and [**display results**](https://grow-ai-like-a-child.com/video-reason/). It's **permissively open-source**, and we welcome everyone to [**join**](https://join.slack.com/t/growingailikeachild/shared_invite/zt-309yqd0sl-W8xzOkdBPha1Jh5rnee78A) us and **build in public together**! 🚀

### Basic Idea

VMEvalKit aims to provide an infrastructure for reasoning research in video models at scale:

- 🎯  [**Task Creation at Scale**](docs/ADDING_TASKS.md): Create question dataset of many different cognitive tasks programmatically at scale and our framework makes sure the dataset to be well-organized.
- 🚀  [**Model Inference at Scale**](docs/INFERENCE.md): Easy one-click inference of the entire question dataset across many video models (commercial APIs + open-source) with automatic resume, error handling, and structured output management, and automatically sync the inference results into the dataset. 
- ⚖️  [**Evaluation Pipeline**](docs/EVALUATION.md): Human evaluation via web interface and AI evaluation via automated MLLM scoring, also automatically sync the eval results into the dataset. 
- ☁️  [**Dataset Management**](docs/DATA_MANAGEMENT.md): Manage question datasets from task creation, inference results from video models, and evaluation results from humans or MLLM pipelines. Provide both AWS S3 or HuggingFace use cases, with version tracking and built-in logging for reproducibility. 

We have completed running a question dataset of [**chess**](/vmevalkit/tasks/chess_task/CHESS.md), [**maze**](/vmevalkit/tasks/maze_task/MAZE.md), [**Sudoku**](/vmevalkit/tasks/sudoku_task/SUDOKU.md), [**mental rotation**](/vmevalkit/tasks/rotation_task/ROTATION.md), and [**Raven's Matrices**](/vmevalkit/tasks/raven_task/RAVEN.md) on [**latest video models**](https://grow-ai-like-a-child.com/video-reason/). Checkout our raw results videos on this [**website**](https://grow-ai-like-a-child.com/video-reason/). Here are a few examples.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hokindeng/VMEvalKit.git
cd VMEvalKit
```

2. **Initialize submodules** - good for optional open-source models and datasets
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

3. **Configure environment** - Copy the example environment file and add your API keys
```bash
cp env.template .env
```

4. **Set up Python environment** – Recommended: use a fresh virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Alternatively, you can use other tools like [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for faster install (`uv venv`), or [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/) if your usecase has cross-language dependencies.

5. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Tasks

The foundation of every VMEvalKit dataset is the **Task Pair**: a set of files defining a single video reasoning challenge.

Each Task Pair consists of three core components:
- 📸 **Initial state image** (`first_frame.png`): shows the starting point or problem to be solved
- 🎯 **Final state image** (`final_frame.png`): illustrates the goal state or solution  
- 📝 **Text prompt** (`prompt.txt`): provides natural language instructions for the video model

Additional details about the task—such as difficulty and task-specific parameters—are recorded in the accompanying `question_metadata.json` file.

All files for a Task Pair are organized together within their own folder:  
`data/questions/{domain}_task/{question_id}/`

Models are expected to generate videos showing the reasoning process that transforms the initial state into the final state.

## Paper & Research

**"Video Models Start to Solve Chess, Maze, Sudoku, Mental Rotation, and Raven's Matrices"**

This codebase implements the experimental framework from our research paper, which demonstrates that leading video generation models (Sora-2, Veo-3, etc.) can perform visual reasoning tasks with >60% success rates.

**Key Findings:**
- Sora-2 achieves 68% overall success rate (87% on maze navigation, 73% on chess)
- Strong correlation (r=0.949) between human and GPT-4o automated evaluation
- Sudoku is most tractable (57% average), mental rotation most challenging (11%)
- Clear performance hierarchy across 6 tested models
