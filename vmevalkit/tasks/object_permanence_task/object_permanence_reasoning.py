"""
Object Permanence Reasoning Task for VMEvalKit

This task tests whether video generation models understand object permanence:
- Objects continue to exist when occluded
- Objects remain unchanged (position, color, shape) when occluder moves
- Objects are revealed when occluder moves away

Design:
- First Frame: Objects fully visible, occluder on left side (not occluding)
- Final Frame: Occluder moved out of frame (right side), objects remain unchanged
- Occluder: Opaque gray panel that moves from left to right
