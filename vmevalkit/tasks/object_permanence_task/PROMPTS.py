Prompts for Object Permanence Tasks

Design: Tell model what objects are in the scene, then ask to move occluder 
from current position to the right until it completely exits the frame.
Final frame should have no occluder, objects remain unchanged.

Unified prompt template that adapts to any number of objects (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)

# Unified prompt template for any number of objects
# Placeholders:
# - {objects_count_description}: Object count description (e.g., "one", "two", "three")
# - {object_word}: Singular or plural form of "object" (e.g., "object", "objects")
# - {objects_description}: Description of all objects (e.g., "a red cube" or "a red cube and a blue sphere")
# - {objects_reference}: Reference to objects (e.g., "the object", "the objects")
# - {objects_pronoun}: Pronoun for objects (e.g., "it", "them")
