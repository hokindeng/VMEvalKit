# Chess Reasoning Task Documentation

## Overview

The Chess Reasoning Task evaluates video generation models' ability to demonstrate strategic thinking and tactical pattern recognition by generating videos that show the solution to chess mate-in-1 positions. This task tests spatial reasoning, pattern recognition, strategic thinking, and precise action demonstration capabilities.

## Task Types

### Mate-in-1 Tasks
- **Description**: Chess positions where one side can deliver checkmate in exactly one move
- **Visual Style**: Standard chess board with pieces in FEN notation
- **Goal**: Find and demonstrate the winning move that delivers immediate checkmate
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy (basic patterns) → Medium (tactical patterns) → Hard (complex positions)
- **Pattern Types**: Back-rank mates, corner mates, queen/rook/knight tactics, discovered attacks

### Pattern Categories

#### Back-Rank Mates
- **Description**: King trapped on back rank by own pieces, attacked by rook/queen
- **Example**: `6k1/5ppp/8/8/8/8/8/R6K w - - 0 1` → Ra8#
- **Tags**: `["back_rank", "rook"]`

#### Queen Corner Mates  
- **Description**: Queen + King coordination against cornered enemy king
- **Example**: `6Qk/8/6K1/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1` → Qh7#
- **Tags**: `["queen", "corner", "endgame"]`

#### Tactical Mates
- **Description**: Knight forks, discoveries, pins leading to mate
- **Example**: Various tactical motifs with immediate mate threats
- **Tags**: `["knight", "fork"]`, `["discovery"]`, `["pin"]`

## Data Structure

### ChessTaskPair
Each task consists of a pair of chess board images and a text prompt:

```python
@dataclass
class ChessTaskPair:
    id: str                         # Unique identifier (e.g., "chess_0001")
    prompt: str                     # Instructions for the video model
    first_image_path: str           # Path to initial chess position image
    final_image_path: str           # Path to position after mate move
    task_category: str              # "Mate-in-1"
    chess_data: Dict[str, Any]      # Position and solution metadata
    difficulty: str                 # "easy", "medium", or "hard"
    side_to_move: str              # "white" or "black"
    mate_moves: List[str]          # List of valid mate moves (SAN notation)
    pattern_tags: List[str]        # Pattern classification tags
    created_at: str                # Timestamp of creation
```

### ChessDataset  
A collection of chess reasoning task pairs with metadata:

```python
@dataclass
class ChessDataset:
    name: str                       # Dataset identifier
    description: str                # Human-readable description
    pairs: List[ChessTaskPair]     # List of chess task pairs
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]        # Additional dataset information
```

### Chess Data Structure
The `chess_data` field contains detailed position information:

```python
chess_data = {
    "initial_fen": "6k1/5ppp/8/8/8/8/8/R6K w - - 0 1",  # Starting position
    "final_fen": "R5k1/5ppp/8/8/8/8/8/6K b - - 0 1",    # Position after mate
    "mate_move": "Ra8#",                                   # Winning move (SAN)
    "all_mate_moves": ["Ra8#"],                           # All possible mates
    "piece_moved": "a1",                                  # From square
    "target_square": "a8",                                # To square
    "is_capture": False,                                  # Whether move captures
    "gives_check": True,                                  # Always true for mates
    "pattern_description": "Classic back-rank mate"       # Human description
}
```

## Visual Representation

### First Frame (Initial Position)
- Shows the chess board with the mate-in-1 position
- All pieces positioned according to the FEN string
- Standard chess board colors (light/dark squares)
- Clear piece distinction (white/black pieces)

### Final Frame (Solution)
- Shows the chess board after the mate move has been played
- The winning piece has moved to its target square
- Target square may be highlighted to show the move
- Position demonstrates checkmate has been achieved

### Board Rendering
- **Format**: PNG images (matching maze dataset format)
- **Size**: 400x400 pixels (configurable)
- **Style**: Standard chess notation and piece symbols
- **Highlighting**: Optional square highlighting for move visualization
- **Check Indication**: Visual indication when king is in check

## Prompts

### Standardized Prompt
The chess task uses a single standardized prompt format:

- **White to move**: "White can deliver checkmate in one move. Show the winning move."
- **Black to move**: "Black can deliver checkmate in one move. Show the winning move."

The system automatically selects "White" or "Black" based on whose turn it is in the position.

## Integration with VMEvalKit

### Task Pipeline
1. **Input Generation**: Chess board images from FEN positions
2. **Model Inference**: Video showing piece movement solution
3. **Solution Extraction**: Parse video to identify move played
4. **Validation**: Verify move legality and checkmate delivery
5. **Scoring**: Rate accuracy, legality, and video quality

### Expected Model Behavior
```
INPUT:  Chess board image + "White to move. Find checkmate in one move."

MODEL:  Generates video showing:
        - Initial board position (first frame)
        - Piece movement animation
        - Final board position with checkmate (last frame)

OUTPUT: Video demonstrating Ra1→Ra8 movement with clear checkmate

VALIDATION: ✅ Move is legal  ✅ Results in checkmate  ✅ Video shows movement
```

## Notes

### Technical Considerations
- Chess positions stored in standard FEN notation
- Board images rendered as SVG (convertible to PNG if needed)
- Move notation uses Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN)
- Multiple solutions supported (various positions have multiple correct answers)
- Both white and black to move positions included

### Model Requirements
- **Visual Processing**: Ability to parse chess board images
- **Pattern Recognition**: Understanding of chess pieces and positions
- **Strategic Reasoning**: Capability to find winning moves
- **Video Generation**: Production of coherent piece movement videos
- **Precision**: Accurate representation of chess moves

### Limitations
- Currently focuses only on mate-in-1 positions (immediate solutions)
- SVG rendering may need PNG conversion for some models
- Position collection emphasizes basic patterns over advanced compositions
- Video analysis requires extraction of moves from generated content

## Research Applications

The chess reasoning task enables research into:

- **Spatial Reasoning**: How models understand 2D board representations
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detection of tactical and strategic patterns
- **Planning**: Ability to identify optimal moves in goal-directed tasks
- **Action Demonstration**: Translation of understanding into video actions
- **Domain Transfer**: Application of reasoning across different problem domains

This task provides a rigorous evaluation framework for assessing video models' reasoning capabilities in the strategic domain of chess, complementing existing spatial reasoning tasks like maze navigation.
